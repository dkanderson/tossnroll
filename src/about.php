							<p>The concept for Toss &amp; Roll started Shanna Lee Bennett (one of the owners) who wanted to provide healthier breakfast and lunch options to a few corporate companies in New Kingston and Liguanea. My wife Keisha and I would assist her with sales and also give advice on the strategy for her business. Shanna Lee recently migrated but she's still a part of our operations giving advice on menu planning and new items we plan to add in the future. Also we wanted to provide meal options that were healthy but not necessarily vegetarian. We wanted to get away from traditional vegetarian meals and simply provide tasty low calorie, low fat and high protein meals to our customers.   We are very big on freshness and so we prepare our ingredients daily to ensure our customers get the freshest healthiest meal possible.</p>
							<p>Jamaicans are becoming increasingly conscious of the nutritional value of the foods they consume and are embracing the eat clean, eat local concept. Our motto is eat right, live better because our aim is to provide a fresh and healthier alternative to lunch. We want persons to lead healthier and longer lives and so we are playing our part by offering meals that help achieve this objective.</p>
